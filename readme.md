## Description

**WooCommerce Order Risk Analyzer** helps store managers quickly spot potentially risky orders right in the WooCommerce orders list:

- **Column Indicator:** shows a colored badge with risk % on each order.  
- **Popover Detail:** on hover or focus, explains which factors contributed.  
- **Configurable Factors:**  
  - Cancellations (multiplier + cap)  
  - Guest checkouts  
  - Repeat customers (reduction + cap)  
- **Admin Settings:** Bootstrap accordion UI to tweak points, caps, and thresholds.  
- **Internationalization:** fully translatable, Greek (`el`) included.

Ideal for spotting fraud or trouble orders before processing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I disable a factor?

Yes. In the settings page, simply set its point to `0`.

### Are translations included?

Greek (`el`) translations are bundled. To translate into another language, use [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) or edit the `.po/.mo` files in the `languages/` folder.

### Will it affect performance?

The plugin caches risk scores on order save and only recalculates when an orderâ€™s status changes, so performance impact is minimal.
